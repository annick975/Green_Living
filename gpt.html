          <h3>Earth friendly air freshener tips</h3>
          <p>Supermarket cleaning aisles are crammed with all sorts of fancy cleaners claiming to do this, that or the other. Some of these cleaners contain highly toxic chemicals that are not only unnecessary, but quite damaging to the environment.

            Our cleaning tasks don’t really need such complex chemical cocktails.
            
            Thankfully, many green cleaners have become available as commercial preparations in recent years. Some of these products are based on materials commonly found around the home such as baking soda, borax, vinegar and eucalyptus oil; all of which I’ve written about in the past.
            
            Here’s another – methylated spirits.</p>
          <b>What is methylated spirits?</b>
        </p>
        <p>Also known as denatured alcohol, methylated spirits is for the most part just plain alcohol (ethyl alcohol). Yes, the alcohol that is in your favorite tipple! Around 90% of methylated spirits is ethanol; so it’s incredibly strong. But before anyone gets ideas, read on.</p>
        <p>The main additive is 10% methanol, which is highly toxic, but it may also include isopropyl alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or other substances. These substances are added specifically to deter people from drinking it. Without it, you can imagine the social implications of having such cheap hooch readily available to all ages.</p>
        <p>The difference between the two alcohols is ethanol is made from grains, fruits and vegetables and methanol usually from wood stock.</p>
        <p>
            <b>WARNING:</b>
            Do not attempt to drink methylated spirits. Methanol can cause blindness, brain damage and death. While some people do drink it regularly, they are usually severely impaired after a while and others have died after their first try. Drinking as little as 10 ml of methanol (two teaspoons) can cause blindness.
        </p>
        <p>Also note that white spirit is not methylated spirits. White spirit is derived from paraffin, a by-product of crude oil processing.</p>
        <p>Uses for methylated spirits.</p>
        <p>– It’s great as a glass cleaner! If you’re going to use it in hot conditions, dilute it with water.</p>
        <p>– In fuel stoves – methylated spirits burns very cleanly; a little too cleanly in fact as it can be hard to see the flame.</p>
        <p>– Methylated spirits can be used to remove ink stains from upholstery or clothes</p>
        <p>– Remove permanent marker from pvc plastics.</p>
        <p>&#8211;As a solvent for thinning paint</p>
        <p>– For cleaning paint brushes as an alternative to fossil fuel based solvents</p>
        <p>– As a general metal cleaner</p>
        <p>– For removing stickers and sticker residue from car windscreens</p>
        <p>– To clean bike disc brakes</p>
        <p>– Cleaning electronics</p>
        <p>– Cleaning CD/DVD laser lenses (use a cotton bud/q- tip)</p>
        <p>Note: always spot test when using methylated spirits/denatured alcohol on fabrics and plastics and take particular care when using on lacquered surfaces. Avoid using on wood items.</p>
        <p>If you’re going to buy denatured alcohol/methylated spirits, probably the “greenest” choice is a brand that contains methanol as the only extra ingredient rather than some of the other more exotic substances I mentioned above.</p>
        <p>Here’s an interesting fact I picked up on Wikipedia: In the United States, small amounts of denatured alcohol are used in many consumer products – and not just cleaning items. It will be listed as “SD alcohol XX”, where SD stands for “specifically denatured” and XX is the formula used in the denaturing process.</p>
        <p>
            To get a better idea of what is used in a methylated spirits brand, search for an <a href="https://greenlivingtips.com/articles/309/1/Whats-in-that-product.html">MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)</a>
            that will show what the formula is.

          <h3>Pets</h3>
          <p>I was quite shocked to discover that what we give our cats to do their business in (cat litter) wreaks a massive toll on the environment.</p>
                      <p>I don &#8217;t own a cat, but I do use kitty litter &nbsp;for other purposes &#8211;under the barbecue and soaking up some messes. I was looking at my bag of cat litter today and thinking &#8220;so, what &#8217;s in this stuff &#8221;?</p>
                      <p>The most common cat litter in use today is made from a natural clay, also known as &#8220;diatomaceous earth &#8221;, or sodium bentonite. It &#8217;s formed into pellets and then dried. The pellets absorb several times their dry weight in moisture.</p>
                      <p>I originally thought that whatever the substance was that made up kitty litter, it was most likely the by-product of some other process. Unfortunately, this type of clay is targeted by mining companies for this specific purpose; using a process called strip mining.</p>
                      <p>Strip mining is as the name implies. Heavy equipment strips off the top layer of earth to get to the seam of clay, which is often quite thin. Strip mining is an incredibly destructive process that has wiped out thousands upon thousands of acres of land and removed millions of tons of earth; just so that cats can take a dump or I can use it to sop up barbecue runoff. I &#8217;ve been reading stories of native lands being acquired and leaseholders kicked off land so that these mining companies can get to it. Rather disgusting isn &#8217;t it?</p>
                      <div class="green-content" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px; " id="green-881132671">

                      </div>
                      <p>There &#8217;s not only that, but the dust from cat litter is made up of tiny silicon particles. The &#8220;bentonite &#8221;aspect of the clay is made up of aluminium phyllosilicate (crystalline silica). These silicon particles are a known carcinogen.</p>
                      <p>From what I &#8217;ve seen, to determine if a particular brand of kitty litter contains sodium bentonite, check the bag for mention of &#8220;natural clay &#8221;or if there are no details, then it most likely does.</p>
                      <p>So what are the alternatives?</p>
                      <p>For my barbecue, I guess I could use sand, and use it sparingly &#8211;only removing sections that became impregnated with oil. That would keep the usage down to about a kilo a year. If you own a cat, there &#8217;s various more earth friendly products available on the marketing including:</p>
                      <p>
                          &#8211;Silica gel pearls (made from sand, no dust)<br/>
                          &#8211;Recycled newspaper that &#8217;s been compressed into pellets<br/>
                          &#8211;Ground corn cobs<br/>
                          &#8211;Extruded straw pellets<br/>
                          &#8211;Pine sawdust from lumber waste<br/>
                          &#8211;Kenaf plant pellets (a fast growing hibiscus)<br/>&#8211;Other products made from cellulose fiber
                      </p>
                      <p>Used cat litter can also be used in your garden as a mulch or fertilizer &#8211;although the idea of it laying on the surface may not appeal :). In that case, just dig a shallow hole and then cover it over.</p>

        <div id="Transport" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>Tyres, recycling and our planet</h3>
          <p>There &#8217;s a common perception the tires we put on our vehicles are made of rubber, a renewable resource. Unfortunately, well over 90% of all tires are made from synthetics &#8211;and they have certainly proved to be an environmental headache.</p>
                                <p>Once tires have reached the end of their serviceable lives, they tend to be dumped in huge piles. If these piles should be set alight, the smoke is an extraordinarily toxic cocktail and the runoff from melted residue can contaminate groundwater.</p>
                                <p>Tires left sitting around in the open also collect rainwater and become perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes.</p>
                                <p>In the USA, about 300 million tires are scrapped or dumped per year. While there &#8217;s been a lot of talk about recycling tires, 25% still wind up in landfills and nearly half of reclaimed tires in the USA are utilized as &#8220;Tire Derived Fuel &#8221;(TDF), usually burned alongside other fuels such as coal.</p>
                                 <p>Burning tires creating huge amounts of air pollution, containing toxins such as:</p>
                                <p>
                                    &#8211;benzene (carcinogen)<br/>
                                    &#8211;lead<br/>
                                    &#8211;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons<br/>
                                    &#8211;butadiene (central nervous system damage, carcinogen)<br/>
                                    &#8211;styrene (potential carcinogen)<br/>
                                    &#8211;dioxins<br/>&#8211;furans
                                </p>
                                <p>So unfortunately, taking tires to recycling center mightn &#8217;t be that earth friendly after all. Check with the center that you go to regarding what happens to the tires they collect.</p>
                                <p>While tires are a necessary evil in our modern lives, there &#8217;s some things we can do to reduce the number of tires that may wind up being used as a toxic fuel alternative or just dumped in landfills. You can also save some cash in the process.</p>
                                <p>You can extend tire life substantially by:</p>
                                <p>
                                    &#8211;checking to see if they are inflated to proper levels<br/>
                                    &#8211;check inflation levels weekly<br/>
                                    &#8211;don &#8217;t speed<br/>
                                    &#8211;corner, brake and start off gently<br/>
                                    &#8211;ensure your tires are properly balanced and rotated regularly<br/>&#8211;don &#8217;t overload your vehicle.
                                </p>
                                <p>Just an important point on tire inflation &#8211;temperature differences will affect pressure levels; even just during the span of a single day. If you check your tires in the morning, chances are the pressure level will be noticeably lower than in the afternoon. This doesn &#8217;t mean that you should adjust inflation umpteen times a day; but it &#8217;s why they should be checked regularly &#8211;as the seasons change, so will your tire pressure. This will also be the case when you travel from an area of low elevation to high elevation.  Aside from environmental and financial reasons, ensuring your tires are properly inflated is an important aspect of safe driving.</p>
                                <p>Tires can be recycled into more tires or repurposed for many other applications, including:</p>
                                <p>
                                    &#8211;insulation blocks<br/>
                                    &#8211;building homes known as &#8220;earthships &#8221;<br/>
                                    &#8211;drainage aggregate<br/>
                                    &#8211;clean fill<br/>
                                    &#8211;planters for tomatoes and potatoes<br/>
                                    &#8211;floor mats<br/>
                                    &#8211;belts<br/>
                                    &#8211;gaskets<br/>
                                    &#8211;shoe soles<br/>
                                    &#8211;seals<br/>
                                    &#8211;washers.<br/>
                                    &#8211;garden edging<br/>
                                    &#8211;compost bins<br/>
                                    &#8211;retaining walls<br/>&#8211;ute/truck mats
                                </p>
                                <p>I have a mat in my ute (called a &#8216;pickup &#8217;in the USA I believe) made from repurposed tires. It prevents the load from rattling on the tray and sliding around. While it was rather pricey, I &#8217;ve had it for 2.5 years now and it has held up very well. It &#8217;s a weaved mat, meaning that water can pass through and doesn &#8217;t get caught under it. The bumpy nature of it gives it extra grip.</p>
                                <p>One of my favorite uses it the potato planter. Lay down a tire, fill with soil and plant a seed potato. When the potato has sprouted and the leaves reach higher than a width of a tire, then add another tire and put in more soil, covering the plant except for the topmost leaves. Repeat the process throughout the life of the plant and you &#8217;ll have a huge crop of potatoes.</p>
                                <p>In regard to concerns about chemicals leaching from tires when used in such a way, it &#8217;s my understanding that old tires aren &#8217;t such a problem &#8211;new tires will offgas volatile compounds; but this decreases and stops over time; while it is in serviceable condition on the vehicle. So when using tires to grow potatoes, the older the tire the better it would seem.</p>

          <h3>Greening Baby Wipes</h3>
          <p>
            I often wonder how our parents got by in the days when there was no such thing as <a href="https://greenlivingtips.com/articles/49/1/Reusable-cloth-vs-disposable-diapers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disposable diapers</a>
            , let alone baby wipes. Wipes are very handy to have around, but I never gave much thought to the environment when I was using them. Heck, I didn’t even know what they were made of. I assumed it was some type of wood fiber.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The baby wipe</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Baby wipe packaging isn’t the only plastic part – the wipes themselves often are too.</p>
        <p>The material used in baby wipes can be made from silk, cotton, polyester, wool, rayon, polyester, polyethylene, and polypropylene – or a mixture. Price conscious consumers are likely getting a product that’s predominantly plastic – which is derived from crude oil.</p>
       
        <p>
            So, the first green tip is to never flush these down the toilet as they are not biodegradable, nor can they be <a href="https://greenlivingtips.com/articles/204/1/Composting-tips.html">composted</a>
            and for obvious reasons, they aren’t recyclable. Unfortunately, they need to go to landfill where they will spend many years before they break down.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The cleanser</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Wipes can incorporate quite a chemical cocktail, including ingredients such as:</p>
        <p>
            – Sodium diamphoacetate<br/>
            – coco phosphatidyl PG-dimonium chloride<br/>
            – hydroxymethyl cellulose<br/>
            – methyl and propyl paraben<br/>
            – <a href="https://greenlivingtips.com/blogs/421/A-call-to-ban-triclosan.html">triclosan</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            There’s not only implications for human health with some of these chemicals, particularly triclosan, but as waste products, they can be toxic in <a href="https://greenlivingtips.com/articles/265/1/Waterway-care.html">aquatic</a>
            and land ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The packaging</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Baby wipe packaging is predominantly plastic. As outlined in my article Recycling by the numbers
            “, not all plastics are created equal. Some can be recycled, others not. It’s important to check the tub for a little triangle with a number in it, which indicates the plastic resin code. If that number is 1 or 2, then it is easily recycled.
        </p>
        <p>If you’re not able to find packaging that can be recycled, try buying a brand that utilizes a container you can reuse for another purpose or one you can buy refills for.</p>
        <p>I came across some baby wipes a while back that had an interesting twist on packaging – it was chalk based; made from a mix of calcium carbonate (chalk) and plastic. However, I didn’t check to see if the packaging was recyclable given the chalk content.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Green baby wipe alternatives</strong>
        </p>
        <p>While for some people total cessation of plastic based baby wipes may not be possible, particularly when travelling or out and about, when at home you can reduce consumption, plastic waste and save money to boot!</p>
        <p>
            You can use something as simple as a diaper soaked in warm water and then just throw it in with your cloth diaper loads. Others have come up with their own “recipes” for making baby wipes you can lug around, such as the ones <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Baby-Wipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
            and <a href="http://www.diaperjungle.com/cloth-diaper-wipes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b>
            when looking around for instructions on how to make baby wipes, I noticed quite a few pages recommending the use of baby oil as a component. As it turns out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baby oil</a>
            is basically mineral oil, derived from crude oil. Environmental issues aside,  there seems to be a lot of controversy as to the possible negative effects on health through applying mineral oil directly to the skin.
        </p>
        <p>There are also some commercially available environmentally friendly baby wipes around that use plant fiber and are free of synthetic chemical additives – and they aren’t all that more expensive. If you run a search on “green baby wipes” or “environmentally friendly baby wipes” on your favorite search engine, you’ll likely find these. Also request that your supermarket stock them – you’ll be helping out the companies that produce these wipes, other eco-conscious shoppers and of course the environment!</p>

          <h3>What is environmental impact?</h3>

          <p>
            Environmental impact refers to the effect that human activities have
            on the natural world. It encompasses the changes, both positive and
            negative, that our actions cause in ecosystems, biodiversity, air
            and water quality, and the overall health of the planet. These
            impacts can be direct, such as pollution from factories or
            deforestation, or indirect, like the carbon emissions contributing
            to climate change. Understanding environmental impact is crucial for
            making informed decisions about how we interact with our
            surroundings and for fostering sustainable practices that minimize
            harm to the environment.

          <h3>What can I do?</h3>
          <p>
            To minimize environmental impact, individuals can adopt various
            sustainable practices in their daily lives. Simple actions, such as
            reducing energy consumption, conserving water, and minimizing waste
            generation, can collectively make a significant difference. Choosing
            eco-friendly transportation options, such as walking, cycling, or
            using public transit, helps reduce carbon emissions. Additionally,
            supporting environmentally responsible products and businesses
            encourages sustainable production and consumption patterns. By
            making conscious choices in our consumption habits, we can
            contribute to preserving the natural world for future generations.
