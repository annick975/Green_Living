          <h3>What is environmental impact?</h3>

          <p>
            Environmental impact refers to the effect that human activities have
            on the natural world. It encompasses the changes, both positive and
            negative, that our actions cause in ecosystems, biodiversity, air
            and water quality, and the overall health of the planet. These
            impacts can be direct, such as pollution from factories or
            deforestation, or indirect, like the carbon emissions contributing
            to climate change. Understanding environmental impact is crucial for
            making informed decisions about how we interact with our
            surroundings and for fostering sustainable practices that minimize
            harm to the environment.

        <div id="Do" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>What can I do?</h3>
          <p>
            To minimize environmental impact, individuals can adopt various
            sustainable practices in their daily lives. Simple actions, such as
            reducing energy consumption, conserving water, and minimizing waste
            generation, can collectively make a significant difference. Choosing
            eco-friendly transportation options, such as walking, cycling, or
            using public transit, helps reduce carbon emissions. Additionally,
            supporting environmentally responsible products and businesses
            encourages sustainable production and consumption patterns. By
            making conscious choices in our consumption habits, we can
            contribute to preserving the natural world for future generations.
